# dead-package-finder

Inherit a large project and not sure if the package.json lists things that are *actually* used in your software? Got failing installs due to really out-of-date packages that you might not need anymore? Get lazy with development and forget to remove packages that you don't use anymore?

This tool is for you!

This walks all the javascript files in a specified directory and uses esprima to find all the `require` statements in them and matches them up against the packages you've declared a dependency on. If you have a declared dependency that you're not requiring, it'll tell you that so you can take the appropriate action.

## Usage

```bash
npm install dead-package-finder
./dead-package-finder [options]
```

## Options
```
Options:
    -h, --help                     print usage information
    -v, --version                  show version info and exit
    -i, --ignore-folder            a list of folders to ignore. node_modules
                                   will ALWAYS be ignored
    -r, --project-root             the path to the directory containing the
                                   package.json file
    -d, --ignore-dev-dependencies  ignore any packages listed in devDependencies
    --verbose                      print out way too much info to even be useful
```
